## Publish the Web app

The Web app is a NextJS application that can be published on any hosting service that supports NodeJS applications.

Vercel is a great option for hosting the Web app, as it is the company that created NextJS and it has a great integration with the framework.

You can publish your Web app on Vercel by following these steps:

1. Install the Vercel CLI, following the steps from the [official documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).
2. Open a terminal inside the root of the Web app and run the following command:

```bash
vercel
```

This will automatically publish your application on vercel.

### Changes to the NodeJS server

After you publish the Web app, a domain will be automatically assigned. You need to allow the NodeJS server to accept requests from this domain.

Inside the NodeJS server, open the `src/config.ts` file. Inside this config file, you will find a `ALLOW_ORIGIN` property. You need to add the domain that was assigned by Vercel to this property.

*If you have a custom domain for your Web app, you need to add that domain to the `ALLOW_ORIGIN` property.*

**Do not forget to update the `WEB_APP_URL` inside the `.env` file in the NodeJS server with the new domain.**

### Firebase changes

Take into account that Firebase will not work with the new domain that was assigned by Vercel. You need to add the new domain to the Firebase console, in the `Authentication` section.
