## Update environment variables

Before deploying the Flutter app, make sure that you open the `.env` file from the app and update the `SERVER_URL`, `WS_SERVER_URL`, `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, `CONFIDENTIALITY_LINK`, `REVENUE_CAT_IOS_API_KEY` and `REVENUE_CAT_GOOGLE_API_KEY` with the correct values.

> `SERVER_URL` is the URL of the server where the server is deployed

> `WS_SERVER_URL` is the URL of the server where the WebSocket server is deployed (e.g. if the server is deployed on `http://my-server.com`, the WebSocket server should be deployed on `ws://my-server.com`. The same applies if you're using only the IP)

> `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is the API key that you get from the Google Cloud Platform. You can find more information about how to get the API key [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started)

> `CONFIDENTIALITY_LINK` is the link to the privacy policy of the app

> `REVENUE_CAT_IOS_API_KEY` is the API key that you get from the RevenueCat dashboard for iOS

> `REVENUE_CAT_GOOGLE_API_KEY` is the API key that you get from the RevenueCat dashboard for Android
