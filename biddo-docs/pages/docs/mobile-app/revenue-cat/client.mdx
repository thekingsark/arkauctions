## Mobile app configuration

The mobile app should only require two API Keys that are found inside the RevenueCat dashboard.

1. Go to the [RevenueCat dashboard](https://app.revenuecat.com/) and select your app.
2. There should already be two API keys (one for iOS and one for Android) that you can use in the mobile app. (If not, you can create them by going to the `API Keys` tab and clicking on the `+ New` button)
3. Copy the API keys and add them to the mobile app, inside the `.env` file.

```dart
REVENUE_CAT_IOS_API_KEY=YOUR_IOS_API_KEY
REVENUE_CAT_GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_ANDROID_API_KEY
```

## Make sure In-App Purchases are enabled on iOS

You need to open the `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` file in Xcode and enable In-App Purchases for the app. 
   <br/>
   <Zoom>
    <Image
      src="/mobile-app/payments/4.png"
      alt="Xcode enable"
      width={1500}
      height={1500}
    />
    </Zoom>


This should normally be enough to have the mobile app configured to work with RevenueCat, as it will automatically fetch the products from the server and display them in the app.

Now, let's see how we can configure the server to work with RevenueCat.

## Testing

If you want to test the payment flow in a sandbox mode (debug), please follow the steps from the [official documentation](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/test-and-launch/sandbox).
