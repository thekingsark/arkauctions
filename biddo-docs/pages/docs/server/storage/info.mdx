## Biddo Storage

Everithing that is an asset inside the Biddo app (images/videos), needs to be stored somewhere.

You have 3 options to store your assets:
1. Google Cloud Storage
2. Amazon S3
3. Disk Storage

You can follow tutorials on how to set up Google Cloud Storage and Amazon S3 in the following pages.

If none of the above options suit you, you can use the Disk Storage option. This option is not recommended for production, but it is good for development.

The Disk Storage is used by default if you do not provide credentials for Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3.

*If you provide both Google Cloud Storage and Amazon S3 credentials, Google Cloud Storage will be used.*
