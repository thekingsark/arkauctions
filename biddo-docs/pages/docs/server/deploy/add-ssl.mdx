# Add SSL certificate

In order to secure the communication between the server and the clients, you need to add an SSL certificate to the server. We are going to use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to generate the SSL certificate.

First of all, you need to make sure that you have a bought domain. You can buy a domain from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), [Google Domains](https://domains.google/), etc.

There is a short tutorial on how to integrate Let's Encryps [here](https://medium.com/@vinoji2005/guide-to-setup-lets-encrypt-ssl-in-nginx-be3d641bb58a)
