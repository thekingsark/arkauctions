## AI Integration

Biddo is using [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for its AI integration.

## Setup

First of all, you need to create an OpenAI account and get an API key from the dashboard. You can get the API key from the [OpenAI API keys page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

To use AI integration, you need to set up the OpenAI API key in the `.env` file.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

You can also set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` inside the admin panel as well. In the admin panel settings, you will also find other configuration options for the AI integration.

If an OPENAI_API_KEY is not available on the server, this functionality will not be available.

A similar behaviour exists in the web app as well.
